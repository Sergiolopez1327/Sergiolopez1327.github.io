### CPSC 120

* [Lab 2 Part 1](https://github.com/cpsc-pilot-fall-2022/cpsc-120-lab-02-Sergiolopez1327/tree/main/part-1)
  
    This lab was my first taste of coding. I had never coded in my life, and had just been thrust into the thick of it. It wasn't too dificult and sparked a greater interest in me to keep coding. This lab was by far my favorite lab.
    
* [Lab 3 Part 1](https://github.com/cpsc-pilot-fall-2022/cpsc-120-lab-03-Sergiolopez1327/tree/master/part-1)

    This lab is where is started to actually get coding, I also met a good friend during this lab who helped me enjoy it better and offered me help. So I am grateful for that but this lab was fun and I thought the testing was cool to see.
    
* [Lab 12 Part 2](https://github.com/cpsc-pilot-fall-2022/cpsc-120-lab-12-sergio-lopez/tree/main/part-2)

    This lab was also very fun because it was something new we had never done, I really enjoyed the end result and on top of that I felt really accomplished to have finished the last lab of the semester.
